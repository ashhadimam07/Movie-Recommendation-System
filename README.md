# Movie-Recommendation-System
Ever wondered, “what algorithm google uses to maximize its target advertisement revenue?”. What about the e-commerce websites like Amazon, Flipkart and many more which advocates you through options such as ‘people who bought this also bought this’. Or “How does Facebook automatically suggest us to tag friends in pictures”?

The answer is recommendation system. With the growing amount of information on Internet, it becomes increasingly important for companies to provide the relevant chunk of information according to user's preferences and tastes.

Therefore, companies now-a-days are building recommendation engines by studying the past behaviour of their users so that they can recommend choices of their interest in terms of “Movies of Interest”, “Suggested Videos” and “Facebook friends that you may know” etc.

So, I had build Movie Recommendation System on "MovieLens 100K Dataset". I had used `Content Based Recommendation` i.e. Content based systems, recommends item based on a similarity comparison between the content of the items and a user’s profile. The feature of items are mapped with feature of users in order to obtain user – item similarity.
